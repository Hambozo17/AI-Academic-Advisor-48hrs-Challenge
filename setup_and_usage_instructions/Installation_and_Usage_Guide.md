- **Academic History**: Realistic progression through terms 1-8
- **Interest Modeling**: 1-3 primary interest areas per student
- **GPA Calculation**: Based on course difficulty and interest alignment

### Reinforcement Learning Engine

**Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation:**

#### State Representation (40+ dimensions)
- Completed courses (binary vector)

- Current GPA and term number
- Interest area weights

#### Reward System
- **+10 points** per course aligned with student interests
- **+5 points** for retaking failed courses
- **+20 points** for graduation progress
- **+5 points** for staying on graduation timeline
- **-20 points** for prerequisite violations
- **-10 points** per course over load limit

#### Deep Q-Network Architecture
- Input Layer: State vector (40+ dimensions)
- Hidden Layers: 256 neurons with ReLU activation and dropout (0.2)
- Output Layer: Q-values for all possible course selections
- Experience Replay: 10,000 transition buffer
- Target Network: Updated every 50 episodes

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Student Generation

```python
from source_code.egyptian_student_generator import StudentSimulator
from source_code.university_curriculum_modeling import create_sample_curriculum

# Create custom student population
curriculum = create_sample_curriculum()
simulator = StudentSimulator(curriculum)

# Generate specific number of students
students = simulator.generate_students(50)

# Customize student characteristics
for student in students:
    # Modify interests, constraints, etc.
    student.interest_weights['AI'] = 0.9
    student.max_courses_per_term = 4
```

### Custom Curriculum Design

```python
from source_code.university_curriculum_modeling import CurriculumGraph

# Create custom curriculum
curriculum = CurriculumGraph()

# Add custom courses
curriculum.add_course('CS401', 'Advanced AI', credits=4, difficulty=9.0, interest_area='AI')
curriculum.add_course('CS402', 'Robotics', credits=3, difficulty=8.5, interest_area='AI')

# Add prerequisites
curriculum.add_prerequisite('CS401', 'CS402')

# Validate structure
assert curriculum.validate_course_sequence(['CS401', 'CS402'])
```

### Training Custom Models

```python
from source_code.deep_learning_advisor import CourseRecommendationAgent

# Initialize agent with custom parameters
agent = CourseRecommendationAgent(
    curriculum=curriculum,
    students=students,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    epsilon=0.3,
    hidden_size=512  # Larger network
)

# Custom training
agent.train(
    num_episodes=1000,
    update_target_freq=25,
    batch_size=64
)

# Save model
agent.save_model('generated_datasets/custom_model.pth')
```

### Generate Custom Reports

```python
from source_code.report_generation_utilities import create_pdf_report

# Generate custom report with your data
create_pdf_report()
# Creates: project_deliverables/Technical_Implementation_Report.pdf
```

### Advanced Visualization

```python
from source_code.university_curriculum_modeling import create_sample_curriculum

curriculum = create_sample_curriculum()

# Highlight specific courses
highlight_courses = {'AI201', 'AI301', 'AI401'}
curriculum.visualize_graph(
    highlight_courses=highlight_courses,
    save_path='charts_and_graphs/ai_track_focus.png'
)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Graph-based Curriculum Modeling
**Rationale**: Directed graphs naturally represent prerequisite relationships and enable efficient traversal for eligibility checking. NetworkX provides robust graph algorithms for topological sorting, path finding, and cycle detection.

**Advantages**:
- Efficient prerequisite validation
- Easy curriculum expansion
- Natural representation of academic dependencies
- Built-in cycle detection prevents impossible requirements

### Egyptian Name Integration
**Rationale**: Demonstrates cultural inclusivity and real-world applicability. Uses authentic Egyptian naming conventions from traditional (Ahmed, Mohamed) to modern (Ziad, Yasmin) names.

**Implementation**:
- 64 carefully selected first names
- Authentic family naming patterns (El-, Abdel-, -i endings)
- Gender-appropriate name assignment
- Cultural balance in name selection

### Deep Q-Network Choice
**Rationale**: DQN handles complex state-action spaces better than heuristic approaches and learns from student success patterns rather than predefined rules.

**Advantages over alternatives**:
- Learns optimal policies from data
- Handles multi-objective optimization naturally
- Adapts to different student types automatically
- Scales to larger curricula and student populations

### Multi-objective Reward Function
**Rationale**: Balances competing objectives (interest alignment, graduation progress, constraint compliance) rather than optimizing single metrics.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Interest alignment encourages engagement
- Graduation progress ensures academic advancement
- Constraint compliance maintains academic integrity
- Penalty system prevents invalid recommendations

### Experience Replay Training
**Rationale**: Improves sample efficiency and training stability by learning from diverse historical experiences rather than only recent interactions.

**Benefits**:
- More stable training convergence
- Better generalization across student types
- Reduced correlation in training examples
- Efficient use of limited training data
