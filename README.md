# AI Academic Advisor - 48 Hours Challenge

> **AI Curriculum Planner: Adaptive Academic Advising for 100 Simulated Students**  
> Complete implementation of graph-based curriculum modeling with reinforcement learning-based personalization

## Challenge Overview

This project implements a personalized academic advising system that:
- Models university curriculum using **graph structures** (29 courses, 32 prerequisites)
- Simulates **100 Egyptian students** with realistic academic histories
- Uses **Deep Q-Network (RL)** for AI-powered course recommendations
- Respects constraints (prerequisites, course load limits, retake policies)
- Aligns recommendations with student interests and graduation goals

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Windows/Linux/macOS**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Academic-Advisor-48hrs-Challenge.git
cd AI-Academic-Advisor-48hrs-Challenge
```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv ai_advisor_env
# Windows:
ai_advisor_env\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source ai_advisor_env/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the System

#### Option 1: Quick Demonstration (Recommended First)
```bash
cd source_code
python system_validation_demo.py
```
**Output:** Validates system functionality with 100 Egyptian students and sample recommendations

#### Option 2: Full AI Training
```bash
cd source_code  
python complete_system_training.py
```
**Output:** Trains Deep Q-Network for 500 episodes with performance metrics

#### Option 3: Generate PDF Report
```bash
cd source_code
python report_generation_utilities.py
```
**Output:** Creates `Technical_Implementation_Report.pdf` in `project_deliverables/`

## Key Features

### Part 1: Graph-Based Curriculum Modeling
- **29 courses** across 5 specialization tracks (AI, Security, Data Science, Software Engineering, Systems)
- **32 prerequisite relationships** enforcing academic progression
- **Constraint modeling**: Course load limits (3-5 courses/term), prerequisite validation, retake policies
- **NetworkX visualization** with hierarchical layout and color-coded tracks

### Part 2: AI-Based Personalization (Reinforcement Learning)
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** with 256-neuron hidden layers
- **State representation**: 40+ dimensional vector (completed courses, GPA, term, interests)
- **Action space**: Course selection respecting constraints
- **Multi-objective rewards**: +10 interest alignment, +20 graduation progress, -20 violations
- **Training**: 500 episodes with epsilon-greedy exploration

### Egyptian Student Integration
- **100 authentic Egyptian students** with names like Ziad Ismail, Yasmin El-Dakrory, Malak Nasser
- **Realistic academic histories** across terms 1-8
- **Diverse performance**: Average GPA 3.36, varied course completion patterns
- **Cultural inclusivity** while maintaining technical rigor

## Results & Validation

### System Performance
- ** Prerequisite validation**: 100% compliance
- ** Course load limits**: All students within 3-5 courses/term
