## Egyptian Cultural Integration

### Authentic Name Representation
- **64 Traditional Egyptian Names**: Ahmed, Mohamed, Fatma, Aisha, Ziad, Yasmin, etc.
- **Authentic Family Names**: El-Sayed, Abdel-Rahman, Hussein, El-Masry, etc.
- **Cultural Balance**: Traditional and modern naming conventions
- **Complete Integration**: Names used throughout system, reports, and examples

### Student Examples
- **Ziad Ismail** (STU001): AI & Software Engineering track
- **Yasmin El-Dakrory** (STU005): AI & Security specialization  
- **Malak Nasser** (STU012): Data Science focus, senior student

- **After**: Hierarchical layout with color-coded tracks, adjacency matrix, statistics

### Organized Code Structure
- **Before**: All files in root directory
- **After**: Logical folder organization (src/, data/, visualizations/, reports/, docs/)

### Comprehensive 2-Page Report
- **Before**: Report didn't meet page requirements
- **After**: Exactly 2 pages covering all challenge requirements:
  - Graph schema explanation with technical details
  - Student generation logic with Egyptian integration
  - RL personalization strategy and design choices
  - Example results for 5 Egyptian students
  - Performance metrics and visualizations
