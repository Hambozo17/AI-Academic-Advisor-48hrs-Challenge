48 Hours Challenge: AI-Powered Academic Advisor
Title: "AI Curriculum Planner: Adaptive Academic Advising for 100 Simulated Students"
Objective: Simulate a personalized academic advising system for a cohort of 100 students using graph-based curriculum modeling and reinforcement learning (or similar techniques) for optimized course path recommendations.

Instructions: You are tasked with:
    PART 1 – Curriculum and Student Simulation (Graph Modeling)
1. Model a university curriculum using a graph structure or graph database.
o Nodes = courses
o Edges = prerequisite relations
2. Simulate 100 students, each with:
o A different collection of completed/passed courses
o GPA and course grades
o Interests (e.g., AI, Security, Data Science)
3. Constraints to model:
o Course load limit: max 3-5 courses per term
o Cannot take a course without completing its prerequisites
o Retake policy for failed courses
4. Submit:
o A script or notebook generating the student data + curriculum graph
o Sample graph schema (or Cypher queries if using Neo4j)
o Optional: Visualize part of the graph (e.g., with NetworkX or Graphviz)

   PART 2 – AI-Based Personalization Strategy
1. Design and implement a high-level personalization algorithm using RL or heuristic-based planning.
o Each student is recommended a set of next-term courses
o Recommendations must:
* Respect constraints
* Align with interests
* Maximize GPA or graduation likelihood
2. If using RL (preferred):
o Define:
* State: current completed courses, GPA, term number, interests
* Action: selecting a set of next-term eligible courses
* Reward: GPA boost, interest alignment, progress toward graduation
3. Train the model (or simulate decisions for at least 10 students).

Deliverables (Within 48 Hours)
